## Requirements

Python 3.x is required and [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) is needed to run the `case_studies` notebook. The calculations are built upon Rodrigo Dorantes-Gilardi's module [biographs](https://github.com/rodogi/biographs). The modules required for the calculation and the plotting of the results are listed in `requirements.txt` and can be installed using

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
